## Hello: I'm Fenestro.


**Command line output isn't pretty, and it tends to scroll away. I'm a simple
Mac app that fixes that for you.**

With the help of commands like [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha#readme) _any_ 
command line output can be converted to HTML.

Throw in some creativity and you can build command line tools or adapters that 
produce beautiful cli output with useful links, images, and anything else you 
can imagine.

I'll take that beautiful HTML, and throw it in a window for you. Throw lots of 
files at me quickly and I'll organize them in one window with a sidebar.

### Common Uses

* saving terminal output for reference
* improved tool output
* quick viewing of local html files
