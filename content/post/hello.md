## Hello: I'm Fenestro.

<object id="fenestro_image" type="image/svg+xml"

**Command line output isn't pretty, and it tends to scroll away. I fix that for you** (on OS X).

With the help of commands like [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha#readme) _any_ ANSI output can be converted to HTML.

Throw in some creativity and you can build command line tools or adapters that produce beautiful cli output with useful links, images, and anything else you can imagine.

I'll take that beautiful HTML, and throw it in a window for you. Throw lots of files at me quickly and I'll organize them in one window with a sidebar.
