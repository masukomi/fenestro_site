## Fenestro Screenshots

Usually screenshots are a great way to show off your app, but I'll display whatever you tell me to, just like your favorite web browser does. Thus, my screenshots could show _anything_.


If you ask Fenestro to render just one piece of HTML you'll see a simple window with your HTML rendered in it.

If you ask Fenestro to a bunch of files quickly, he'll group them and give you a nav bar to change between them.
